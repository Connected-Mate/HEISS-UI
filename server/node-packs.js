/**
 * Every ComfyUI custom node pack HEISS knows how to ask for. A model family,
 * a runner or a feature names its pack by id; setup panels then offer the same
 * two routes for all of them (ComfyUI-Manager's Git URL install, or one
 * terminal command) and notice by themselves when the nodes arrive.
 *
 * id: { name, repository, folder (its custom_nodes folder), nodes (classes
 *       that prove it is loaded), commit and ref (the reviewed version HEISS
 *       installs, see below), search (optional: what finds it in Manager's
 *       node list), manager (optional: its id there, so one click can queue
 *       the install in Manager), note (optional, one line for the panel),
 *       subdir (optional: where the pack sits inside its repository, for
 *       makers who ship it next to their model code; only that folder lands
 *       in custom_nodes), requirements (false when the pack has no
 *       requirements.txt, so the terminal steps leave pip out) }
 *
 * commit pins the exact code a one-click install clones: a pack's moving
 * branch could change under us, and whatever lands in custom_nodes runs with
 * ComfyUI's rights. It is the latest tagged release where the pack tags them,
 * else the default branch as it was when reviewed; `ref` says which, for
 * people reading the install panel. Moving to a newer version is a reviewed
 * change here, never automatic. Last reviewed 2026-09-28.
